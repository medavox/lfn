**La Ovo**

Par: Andy Weir


Tu ia viaja a casa, cuando tu ia mori.

Lo ia es un colide de auto. No notable spesial, ma fatal an tal. 
Tu ia lasa un sposa e du enfantes. Lo ia es un mori sin dole.
La paramedicistes ia fa la plu bon cual los pote a salva
tu, ma lo ia es futil. Tua corpo ia es tan fratida absoluta ce 
lo ia es plu bon en esta modo, fida me.

E acel es cuando tu ia encontra me.

“Cual… cual ia aveni?” Tu ia demanda. “Do es me?”

Tu ia mori,” me ia dise, pratical. No razona a parla nondireta.

On ia ave un… un camion e lo ia patini…”

Si,” me ia dise.

“Me… me ia mori?”

“Si. Ma no es triste. Cadun mori,” me ia dise.

Tu ia vide a sirca. On ia ave noncosia. Sola tu e me. 
“Cual es esta loca?” Tu ia demanda. 
“Esce esta es la ultravive?”

“Plu o min,” me ia dise.

“Esce tu es dio?” Tu ia demanda.

“Ie,” me ia responde. “Me es Dio.”

“Mea enfantes… mea sposa,” tu ia dise.

“Como de los?”

“Esce los va es oce?”

“Acel es cual me gusta a vide,” me ia dise. “Tu ia mori nova e tua conserna xef
es per tua familia. Acel es cualia bon.”

Tu ia regarda me con fasina. En tua persepi, me no pare como Dio. 
Me ia pare como mera alga om. O posible un fem. 
Alga figur neblin de autoria, cisa. 
Plu como un ensenior de scola gramatica ca la Omnipotente.

“No ajita tu,” Me ia dise. “Los va es bon. Tua xices va recorda tu como 
perfeta en cada modo. Los no ia ave tempo a deveni despetosa de tu.
Tua sposa va plora a estra, ma va es lejerida secreta. 
En justa, tua sposia en curso de ia fali. Si lo es cualce consola, 
el ia senti culpable multe per senti lejerida.”

“O,” tu ia dise. Donce cual va aveni a pos? Esce me vade a la sielo o la enferno o simil?”

“No la un e no la otra,” me ia dise. “Tu va reincarne.”

“A,” tu ia dise. “Alora la Indus ia dise coreta,”

“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”
“Tota la relijios es coreta en sua modo propre,” me ia dise. “Pasea con me.”

You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”
Tu ia segue en cuando nos ia gami tra la vacua. “Do nos vade?”

“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”
“A no loca spesifada,” me ia dise. “Lo es mera bon a pasea en cuando nos parla.”

“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be
a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did
in this life won’t matter.”
“Donce cual es an la razona?” tu ia demanda. “Cuando me es renaseda, me va recorda no cosa, si?
 Un bebe. Alora tota mea esperias e tota la cosas cual me ia fa en esta vive no va importa.”

“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences
of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”
"Acel no es la caso!” me ia dise. “Tu ave en tu tota la sabe e esperias de tota tua vives pasada.
Tu mera no recorda los aora mesma.”


I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more
magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A
human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like
sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You
put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back
out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.

Me ia para pasea e ia prende tu par la spalas. 
“Tua spirito ed plu merveliosa, bela e jigante ca tu pote posible imajina.
Un mente umana pote sola conteni un frato pico de cual tu es.
Lo es como pone tua dito en un vitro de acua per serti egal si lo es calda o fria.
Tu pone un parte pico de tu en la vaso, e cuando tu reprende estra lo,
tu gania tota la esperias cual lo ia ave.

“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched
out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out
here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no
point to doing that between each life.”

“Tu ia es un umana de la 48 anios pasada, 
donce tu no es ancora plen estendeda e 
ia senti la resta de tua consensia enorme.
Si nos ta pigri asi per un tempo sufisinte,
tu ta comensa recorda tota cosas.
Ma on ave no razonas a fa lo entre cada vive.”

“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”
“Cuantia de veses me ia es alora renaseda?”

“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said.
“This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”

“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”

“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your
universe. Things are different where I come from.”

“Where you come from?” You said.

“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there
are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but
honestly you wouldn’t understand.”

“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to
other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some
point.”

“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own
lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”

“So what’s the point of it all?”

“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of
life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”

“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.

I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this
whole universe, is for you to mature.”

“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”

“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life
you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”

“Just me? What about everyone else?”

“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and
me.”

You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”

“All you. Different incarnations of you.”

“Wait. I’m *everyone*!?”

“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.

“I’m every human being who ever lived?”

“Or who will ever live, yes.”

“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”

“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.

“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.

“And you’re the millions he killed.”

“I’m Jesus?”

“And you’re everyone who followed him.”

You fell silent.

“Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing
yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself.
Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will
be, experienced by you.”

You thought for a long time.

“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”

“Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are.
You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”

“Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”

“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived
every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be
born.”

“So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…”

“An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next
life.”

And I sent you on your way.
